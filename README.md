# Prop-eller
**Prop-eller**: Formal Property Verification Components to Speedup Complex Checks.

## Structure
* [data_integrity_checker](https://github.com/dh73/Prop-eller/tree/main/data_integrity_checker): An IP for End-to-end checks with Formal.
* [synthesizable_checkers](https://github.com/dh73/Prop-eller/tree/main/synthesizable_checkers): A synthesizable implementation of different model checking properties that can be used for formal, FPGA and emulation. They are optimized and their main goal is to be easy to use.
